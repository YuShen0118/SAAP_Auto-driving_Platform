Roadmap:
- Better Clouds
- Static Weather Zones
- More camera types (3rd person, etc.)

Change Log:

2.9.1	:	2017-09-11
		-	Fix compile error when deleting demo folder.

		-	Added an additional day ambient sound.

2.9.0	:	2017-09-09
		-	Added Unity network support. Weather profiles and Weather manager are supported.
		-	Restructured the prefab into logical child object groups. The prefab continues to grow and this helps keep it organized.

		-	Added weather profiles. A simpler way to create different sets of weather.

2.7.7	:	2017-09-02
		-	Fix sound dampening.
		-	Fix GAIA integration.

2.7.6	:	2017-08-28
		-	Added ambient sound to day night script.

2.7.5	:	2017-08-23
		-	Full screen cloud and fog fixes.

2.7.4	:	2017-08-22
		-	Integrations compile error fixes.

2.7.3	:	2017-08-19

		-	Fix billboard clouds in multi-pass VR and fix null ref exception.

2.7.0	:	2017-08-11
		-	Added full screen clouds script (3D only). This replaces sky sphere clouds and paves the way for volumetric and much nicer looking clouds.
		-	2D sun intensity reduces as night approaches.
		-	Renamed CloudScript property of Weather Maker Script to LegacyCloudScript2D. The new CloudScript property now points to the new full screen cloud script. I'll do better 2D clouds in the future as well.

2.6.1	:	2017-08-01
		-	Fix lens flare blocker.
		-	Fix fog lights starting at night.
		-	Fix shadow projector to fade smoothly.
		-	Added null fog zone prefab - cuts out fog in the full screen fog, up to 8 visible supported. Zones must not overlap. See DemoSceneNullFogZoneAndSoundDampler.
		-	Added sound dampening prefabs. Great for reducing wind, rain and thunder sounds when in-doors. See DemoSceneNullFogZoneAndSoundDampler.

2.6.0	:	2017-07-29
		-	Added shadow option to fog script. Currently this only applies to the sun, but future light types may be added in the future.
		-	Lighting settings no longer requires nulling out the skybox.
		-	Added update interval do day/night script. Increase this if you are seeing shadow flickering, etc.
		-	Full screen fog now supports multi-pass stereo rendering.
		-	Moved ambient colors back into the day/night cycle script, which is a much better place for them.
		-	Primary fall particle system for precipitations now use world space and circle emitters, great for VR.
		-	Remove cloud only sky sphere option as this had introduced a whole lot of rendering bugs. I'll create a separate cloud effect in a future version.
		-	2D particle systems now honor the start speed and size ranges instead of averaging them.

2.5.4	:	2017-07-19
		-	Fix GPU stall from read pixels in cloud shadow projector script.

		-	Added sun shafts (beta). This needs to be improved but is a proof of concept. Not VR compatible yet.
		-	Fixes and improvements for all particle systems.
		-	Add lens flare blocker. When the lens flare is behind clouds, it will fade out as if it was behind opaque geometry.

2.5.1	:	2017-07-12
		-	Unity 2017 support.
		-	Standardize dithering algorithm, add time as an input to dithering.

		-	Gaia Integration. Under the Gaia manager, GX tab, Digital Ruby, LLC -> Weather Maker are a number of useful options.
		-	2D mode has a SkyPlane object for procedural sky, see DemoScene2D. This is still a work in progress.
		-	Fixes for 2D lightning.
		-	More null camera checks.
		-	Fix cloud shadow projector flickering.

2.3.2	:	2017-06-19
		-	Added procedural cloud only option to sky sphere. With this option, you use your own skybox. See DemoSceneTransparentSkySphere for details.
		-	Sky sphere, moon and sun render queues have been changed to go right before the transparent queue. This should vastly improved performance via depth buffer rejection of sky, moon and sun pixels, although performance was already still very good.
		-	Fix ground lightning appearance.
		-	The WindDirection property has been removed. The rotation of the Wind object now determines the wind direction (i.e. transform.forward).
		-	Added max wind change direction property.

		-	Refactor fog - it looks a lot better and scatters directional lights more realistically. Fog has proper 3D noise.
		-	Storm cloud sharpness now uses the same value as other cloud types for performance.
		-	Removed fog noise texture parameter as all fog uses a 3D noise texture now.
		-	Removed fog noise height parameters as fog noise is now 3D.

		-	Fix rain not showing in demo scene

2.2.1	:	2017-05-11

		-	Fix fog box prefab and add fog sphere prefab.

2.2.0	:	2017-05-05
		-	Added infrastructure for multiple suns. Only one sun is still supported currently. See the Suns array on WeatherMakerScript.Instance.
		-	Added support for multiple moons. See the Moons array on WeatherMakerScript.Instance. Multiple moons are supported! Earth moon and mars are added by default. Mars is obviously bigger than it should be.
		-	Sun and moons get slightly bigger at the horizon.
		-	Multiple camera support. See DemoSceneMultipleCameras. Sky sphere, rain, etc. and full screen fog render against multiple cameras.
		-	Moved the sky sun to it's own mesh renderer. This was needed to support multiple moons and multiple moon eclipses.
